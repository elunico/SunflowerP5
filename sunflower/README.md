# Sunflower p5

I made this p5.js sketch as a Coding Challenge sort of thing after watching this Numberphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg).

It took 25 minutes, which is not bad considering it was my first challenge and I had to look up everything in the documentation.

I attempted to recreate the simulation they used in the video for showing seeds around a sunflower, because I thought it was pretty.

This was also inspired by the work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://thecodingtrain.com/) from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) on Youtube. He has a [style of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) where he codes out some creative design objective using p5 or processing. Those videos have really inspired a lot new ways in which I think about code, solving problems, and achieving goals with software.

It was also made possible by the great work of the [Processing Foundation](http://processing.org). They make great tools like processing and p5.js.
